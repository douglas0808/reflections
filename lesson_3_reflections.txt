When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1.When you are working with someone on the same project.  
2.When you want files resided on several computers synchronized.
3.When you don't have access to your own computer, you can still work on github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You can review the changes on GitHub before accepting the changes into your own Git.
