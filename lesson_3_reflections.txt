When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1.When you are working with someone on the same project.  
2.When you want files resided on several computers synchronized.
3.When you don't have access to your own computer, you can still work on github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You can review the changes on GitHub before accepting the changes into your own Git.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks happens only on GitHub.  Go to the repository you want to fork and add it to your GitHub as a fork.
You can clone a repository from GitHub to your git, or on your own computer.
You create a branch of your repository if you want to test some new features or do some experiements.  You can later either merge the branches. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can work offline. You can diff the local brnach with the remote branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
We would send the files to collaborators and let them know the changes you have made.  
Git and GitHub would be a lot of easier.
